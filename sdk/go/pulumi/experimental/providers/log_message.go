	Message string
	// The (optional) resource urn this log is associated with.
	URN string
	// The (optional) stream id that a stream of log messages can be associated with. This allows clients to not have to buffer a large set of log messages that they all want to be conceptually connected.  Instead the messages can be sent as chunks (with the same stream id) and the end display can show the messages as they arrive, while still stitching them together into one total log message. 0 means do not associate with any stream.
	StreamId string
	// Optional value indicating whether this is a status message.
